# Complexity Challenge 2018

## Agents & Strategies
- Stable - Always on the stable pool. Risk averse
- Sticky - Stay in the same pool as the initial
- Random - Doesnâ€™t look at prior payoffs
- Always new - Always change pool
- Bandwagon - Always choose a pool that has the most number of agents in the previous time step
- Safe - Always choose a pool that had the most agents with payoffs in the previous time step
- Robert Frost - Always choose the least chosen pool (based on average number of agents that have previously chosen it)
- High Roller - Always choose a pool with the highest payoff in the previous time step
- Opportunistic - Always choose a pool with the highest average payoff

## Analysis
- What general behaviors arise in the system? 
- How does the wealth of the agents change over time? 
- How does the diversity of strategies influence the dynamics of the system?
- Are there generally classes of agent behavior (say, based on what data they use, how they process it, or the agent's overall sophistication) that lead to better performance?
